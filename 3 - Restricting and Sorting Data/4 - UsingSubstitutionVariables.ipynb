    "<h3>How Substitution Variables Work</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Substitution variables are often represented by an ampersand (&) followed by the variable name.\n",
    "    When the query runs, SQL*Plus or SQL Developer prompts the user to input a value for each variable.\n",
    "    The entered value replaces the variable in the query for that particular execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Basic Syntax:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can create substitution variables by using &variable_name within your query.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> to query employees based on a specific department, you can use a substitution variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = &dept_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "When executed, the user will be prompted to input a department ID. This value will be used in place of &dept_id in the query."

    "<h3>Using Double Ampersands for Persistent Values</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>A double ampersand (&&) can be used to define a persistent substitution variable. \n",
    "<br>This means that once a value is provided, it is reused throughout the session without prompting again.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = &&dept_id;\n",
    "\n",
    "If you enter a value for &&dept_id, it will be used for the remainder of the session until it is redefined or the session ends."

    "\n",
    "<strong>The ACCEPT command can be used to control how substitution variables prompt users for input, which is especially useful in SQL*Plus.</strong>\n",

    "<strong>Example:</strong>\n",
    "\n",

    "    SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = &dept_id;\n",
