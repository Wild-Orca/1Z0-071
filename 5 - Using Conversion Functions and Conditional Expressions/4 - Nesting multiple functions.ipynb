    "<strong>Practical Use Cases:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Increased Flexibility: Nesting allows for more complex data manipulations in a single query, making SQL powerful for reporting and analysis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Reduced Query Complexity: It can reduce the number of intermediate steps needed, making the code cleaner and easier to read.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Enhanced Readability: When used appropriately, nesting can make queries more straightforward by eliminating the need for subqueries or temporary tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Best Practices:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keep It Simple: Avoid deeply nested functions that may reduce readability. Limit nesting to two or three levels where possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Comment Your Code: When using nested functions, include comments explaining the purpose of the nested structure to aid understanding for future readers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Test Intermediate Outputs: Break down complex queries and test each function individually to ensure they produce the expected results before nesting them."
