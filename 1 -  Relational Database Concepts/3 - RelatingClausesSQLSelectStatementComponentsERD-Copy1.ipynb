    "\n",
    "    Entities: Represented as tables in the database (e.g., Customer, Order).\n",
    "    Attributes: Columns within tables (e.g., CustomerID, OrderDate).\n",
    "    Relationships: Define how entities are connected (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).\n",
    "    Primary Keys (PK): Unique identifiers for each entity instance.\n",
    "    Foreign Keys (FK): Connect related entities by referencing primary keys of other entities.\n",

    "<strong>Overview of the SQL SELECT Statement</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT - Defines the columns to retrieve.\n",
