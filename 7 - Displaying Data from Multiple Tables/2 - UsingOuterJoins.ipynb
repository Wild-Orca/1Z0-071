    "\n",
    "<strong>There are three main types of OUTER JOINS in SQL:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>LEFT OUTER JOIN (or LEFT JOIN):</strong> Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. If there’s no match, the result includes NULL for columns from the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT column_names\n",
    "      FROM table1\n",
    "      LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or RIGHT JOIN):</strong> Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table. If there’s no match, the result includes NULL for columns from the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT column_names\n",
    "      FROM table1\n",
    "      RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>FULL OUTER JOIN:</strong> Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOINs to return all records when there is a match in one of the tables. Unmatched rows from both tables will show NULL in place of columns from the other table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT column_names\n",
    "      FROM table1\n",
    "      FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;"

    "<h3>When to Use OUTER Joins</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>LEFT JOIN:</strong> Use when you want to retain all rows from the primary (left) table, regardless of matching rows in the secondary table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>RIGHT JOIN:</strong> Use when all rows from the secondary (right) table are needed, along with any matches from the primary table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>FULL OUTER JOIN:</strong> Use when you want all records from both tables, whether or not they match, to ensure no data is omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT e1.first_name AS \"Employee\", e2.first_name AS \"Manager\"\n",
    "      FROM employees e1, employees e2\n",
    "     WHERE e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;"

    "<strong>Best Practices:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Select Only Necessary Columns: Specify only the columns you need, as OUTER JOINS can result in large result sets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Use WHERE Clause for Additional Filtering: You can combine OUTER JOINS with the WHERE clause to further filter your results as needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Check for NULL Values: Since OUTER JOINS often produce NULL for unmatched records, plan for potential NULL handling or replacement."
