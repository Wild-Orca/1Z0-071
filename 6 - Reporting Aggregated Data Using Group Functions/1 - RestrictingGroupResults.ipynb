    "    \n",
    "    SUM: Adds up all values in a specified column.\n",
    "    AVG: Calculates the average of a column's values.\n",
    "    COUNT: Counts the number of rows, or non-NULL values, in a column.\n",
    "    MAX: Finds the maximum value in a column.\n",
    "    MIN: Finds the minimum value in a column."
