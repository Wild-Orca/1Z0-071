    "<h3>ROUND</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>The ROUND function rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places. If no decimal places are specified, it rounds to the nearest whole number.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Syntax:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    ROUND(number, decimal_places)\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Explanation:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    number: The numeric value to be rounded.\n",
    "    decimal_places: (Optional) The number of decimal places to round to. \n",
    "    If positive, it rounds to the right of the decimal point; if negative, to the left.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    SELECT ROUND(salary) AS \"Rounded Salary\" FROM employees;\n",

    "    number: The numeric value to be truncated.\n",
    "    decimal_places: (Optional) The number of decimal places to keep. \n",
    "    If omitted, it defaults to 0, meaning it will truncate to a whole number.\n",

    "<strong>Practical Use Cases:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    ROUND: Use this to format financial data or other numeric values where exact precision is necessary. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    TRUNC: Ideal for when exact values are needed without rounding, such as displaying scores or measurements in a standardized format.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    MOD: Commonly used for operations that require divisibility checks, such as batch processing or categorizing even/odd values.\n",

    "<strong>Best Practices:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Always be mindful of the context in which you are using each function:\n",

    "    Use ROUND when precise rounding is required.\n",
    "    Use TRUNC when the exact whole or decimal value is needed.\n",
    "    Use MOD for remainder-based calculations or to apply logic based on divisibility."
