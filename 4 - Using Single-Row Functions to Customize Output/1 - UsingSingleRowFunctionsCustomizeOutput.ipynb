    "<h3>Examples of Common Character Functions</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>UPPER, LOWER, and INITCAP:</strong> These functions adjust text case, often used for consistent formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Retrieve all employee names in uppercase:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS \"Uppercase Name\" FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Convert a department name to lowercase:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT LOWER(department_name) AS \"Lowercase Dept\" FROM departments;\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Display the first letter of each word capitalized:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT INITCAP(last_name) AS \"Proper Name\" FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><strong>CONCAT:</strong> Combines two columns or strings into one output field.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Concatenate first and last names to display full names:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ') || last_name AS \"Full Name\" FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><strong>SUBSTR:</strong> Extracts a portion of a string, based on position and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Display the first three letters of employee last names:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT SUBSTR(last_name, 1, 3) AS \"Short Name\" FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><strong>LENGTH:</strong> Returns the length of a string, useful for data validation or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Find the length of each last name:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT last_name, LENGTH(last_name) AS \"Name Length\" FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><strong>INSTR:</strong> Finds the position of a substring within a string. If not found, it returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Find the position of the letter 'a' in each last name:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT last_name, INSTR(last_name, 'a') AS \"Position of 'a'\" FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><strong>TRIM:</strong> Removes specific characters from the beginning or end of a string. If no characters are specified, it defaults to removing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Trim spaces from both sides of a job title:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT TRIM(job_title) AS \"Trimmed Title\" FROM jobs;\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><strong>LPAD / RPAD:</strong> Pads a string with characters on the left (LPAD) or right (RPAD) to reach a specified length.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Add leading zeroes to a four-character employee ID to reach eight characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT LPAD(employee_id, 8, '0') AS \"Padded ID\" FROM employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><strong>REPLACE:</strong> Substitutes occurrences of a specified substring with another string.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Example:</strong> Replace occurrences of 'Manager' with 'Supervisor':\n",
    "\n",
